      <h1>About the Book</h1>
      <h3>Dr Otubo Victor O. </h3>

      <div class="sample">

          <p>
    Dr. OVO was barely 10 years old when he watched his little sister die from something that 
    should never have taken her life. Today, his work is preventing one maternal and child death 
    every 30 seconds in communities across Africa.
    If you have ever been bothered, what you need to know medically as it regards sex, who to 
    marry, how to plan for pregnancy and safe delivery, raise kids that are always healthy, and 
    retain your spark as a woman, or as a couple, this book covers it all.

    before accepting a man or choosing a lady, the journey before, in and after pregnancy, how 
    to nurse healthy babies, and how to maintain your spark after each pregnancy. All common 
    reasons why babies die and how to keep yours (or your future kids) safe, and just so much 
    more.
            </p>
            <p>

    <h4>Why I wrote this book </h4>
    <h2>The story behind the book</h2>
    <p>
     My name is Victor, but many know me as Dr. OVO. I’m a husband, a dad, a passionate African 
change agent, a medical doctor, a writer, and now the author of this book—My Family 
Companion. But long before my big moves, preventing one maternal and child death every 
30 seconds in communities across Africa, I was just a 10-year-old boy living in a quiet 
neighborhood with my parents and siblings.
One night changed my life forever.
 <a href="#" id="toggle-about" class="read-toggle-inline">See More</a>
    </p>
    <div id="about-more" class="more-content hidden">
        <p>
       It was around midnight. I was fast asleep like every other child should be. Suddenly, I was 
jolted awake by screams from the sitting room. Something in those voices wasn’t normal—
it wasn’t the usual noise of adults talking or scolding. This was panic. Urgency. Fear.
I rushed out of our room, and there they were—my parents and a few neighbors gathered 
around my baby sister. She was just about 8 months old. Her tiny body was stiff, jerking 
uncontrollably. 
Everyone was shouting suggestions at once.
        </p>
        <p>
      “Hold her down!”
“Put a spoon in her mouth before she swallows her tongue!”
“Get onions! Squeeze it into her nose!”
“Put her legs over the fire—she’s cold!”
        </p>
      <p>
The noise was deafening, the chaos overwhelming. But what struck me most was that 
everyone was so sure—so convinced that those were the right things to do. Nobody knew 
what was really happening, but nobody wanted to be quiet either.
As a child, I stood there, frozen. Something deep inside me—something I can’t even 
explain—was definite that everything they were doing was wrong. I didn’t have the words or 
the confidence to speak, but I knew they weren’t right.
We later found out she had suffered a febrile convulsion—a fairly common condition in 
infants when their fever spike. In fact, if they had not interfered, her outcome could have 
been better.
But what happened instead was a tragedy. The well-meaning interventions caused injuries 
that led to months of hospitalization, costly treatments, and eventually… her death.
We lost her.
      </p>
      <p>
My little sister.
And I lost something too—my innocence. That night, I became someone else. I didn’t just 
watch my sister suffer—I watched helplessly as ignorance cost her life. I made a vow that 
night. I didn’t say it out loud, but I meant it with every fiber of my being: I will become a doctor. 
I will make sure no child ever dies like this again—not on my watch.
That painful night planted a seed in me, and this book is one of the fruits. Every page, every 
chapter, every word is written with her memory in my heart and with the hope that one 
mother, one father, one family will read and make better choices—so their child gets to live, 
thrive, and grow.

</p>
      <p>
Then, I was shocked!
I got into medical school and began to see that my story was not unique; I witnessed many 
other avoidable tragedies—young ladies getting rhesus sensitized and never being able 
to conceive babies ever again, children dying from simply growing new teeth,
miscarriages happening in women treating malaria, healthy babies sleeping and dying 
in their sleep, and so many very odd experiences. What seemed like routine cases to my 
colleagues and teachers, were to me, deep personal stories of frustration, confusion, and 
pain—mostly caused by a lack of clear, accessible health information. Families were losing 
too many women and children to conditions that could have been prevented if people simply 
had the right knowledge.
That realization birthed the desire to write a compelling book that is completely relatable to 
a non-medical reader, covering all common issues from singlehood through pregnancy to 
parenting.
      </p>
      <p>
That book is now 
here—My Family Companion.
It is rich with real stories (shared by real people) of common issues that affect young sexually 
active singles, medical insights for choosing sex and marriage partners, tips for having safe 
pregnancy and deliveries, how and why babies get sick and die, including healthy ones who 
simple die in their sleep, and how to prevent these or what to do in strange scenarios, and 
so, so, so much more that will blow every readers mind.
      </p>
      
      <p>
My very senior colleague, who has done extensive health work across the world, read the 
book, and this was his review: 
      </p>
      <p>
“As a doctor
As a writer
And just as a person
My Family Companion is simply the best, most relatable, ‘medically non-medical’books I’ve 
ever read.
      </p>
      <p class="">Wow!”</p>
      <p>
