      <h1>My Family Companion</h1>
      <h3>Dr Otubo Victor</h3>
      <!-- <h2>$10.94</h2> -->
      <p>
Dr. OVO was barely 10 years old when he watched his little sister die from something that 
should never have taken her life. Today, his work is preventing one maternal and child death 
every 30 seconds in communities across Africa.
If you have ever been bothered, what you need to know medically as it regards sex, who to 
marry, how to plan for pregnancy and safe delivery, raise kids that are always healthy, and 
retain your spark as a woman, or as a couple, this book covers it all.
      </p>
      <div id="book-more" class="more-content hidden">
        <p>
It's for every individual who ever intends to have or currently has a family—it covers everyday 
life, sex before marriage (important do's and don'ts), untold blood issues you must consider
before accepting a man or choosing a lady, the journey before, in and after pregnancy, how 
to nurse healthy babies, and how to maintain your spark after each pregnancy. All common 
reasons why babies die and how to keep yours (or your future kids) safe, and just so much 
more.
        </p>
        <p>
All are covered in the simplest and most practical sense. It is written for:
• Every sexually active single 
• Anyone looking forward to starting a family, sooner or later,
• About-to-wed couples,
• Newlyweds,
• and households with children under five years old

    <h4>About the book </h4>
    <h2>The story behind the book</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Victor, but many know me as Dr. OVO. I’m a husband, a dad, a passionate African and change agent, a medical doctor, a writer, and now the author of this book—The Family Companion. But long before my moves for change across Africa and much longer before the white coat and the stethoscope, I was just a 10-year-old boy living in a quiet neighborhood with my parents and siblings.
One night changed my life forever.
    </p>
    <div id="about-more" class="more-content hidden">
        <p>
        It was around midnight. I was fast asleep like every other child should be. Suddenly, I was jolted awake by screams from the sitting room. Something in those voices wasn’t normal—it wasn’t the usual noise of adults talking or scolding. This was panic. Urgency. Fear.
    I rushed out of our room, and there they were—my parents and a few neighbors gathered around my baby sister. She was just about 8 months old. Her tiny body was stiff, jerking uncontrollably. 
    Everyone was shouting suggestions at once.
        </p>
        <p>
        “Put a spoon in her mouth before she swallows her tongue!”
    “Get onions! Squeeze it into her nose!”
    “Put her legs over the fire—she’s cold!”
        </p>
      <p>
The noise was deafening, the chaos overwhelming. But what struck me most was that everyone was so sure—so convinced that those were the right things to do. Nobody knew what was really happening, but nobody wanted to be quiet either.
As a child, I stood there, frozen. Something deep inside me—something I can’t even explain—was definite that everything they were doing was wrong. I didn’t have the words or the confidence to speak, but I knew they weren’t right.
We later found out she had suffered a febrile convulsion—a fairly common condition in infants when their fever spikes. In fact, if nothing had been done, the seizure ordinarily would have ended on its own, and she could have just been fine and taken to the hospital shortly afterwards.
But what happened instead was a tragedy. The well-meaning interventions caused injuries that led to months of hospitalization, costly treatments, and eventually… her death.
We lost her.
      </p>
      <p>
My little sister.
And I lost something too—my innocence. That night, I became someone else. I didn’t just watch my sister suffer—I watched helplessly as ignorance cost her life. I made a vow that night. I didn’t say it out loud, but I meant it with every fiber of my being: I will become a doctor. I will make sure no child ever dies like this again—not on my watch.
That painful night planted a seed in me, and this book is one of the fruits. Every page, every chapter, every word is written with her memory in my heart and with the hope that one mother, one father, one family will read and make better choices—so their child gets to live, thrive, and grow.

My Note to You
From my time in medical school, I began to see that my story was not unique; several patients we admitted at the Children's Emergency were on account of complications from traditional intervention and care for newborns and infants. The majority of these happened during omugwo. This is why I chose to share my story here in this chapter. 
Omugwo is a traditional postpartum care practice by many families—full of love, support, and warmth. But it also carries risks when old, unproven remedies are followed blindly.
This chapter is personal for me because I have seen, firsthand, what can go wrong when misinformation and panic take over.
For instance, febrile convulsions are not uncommon. They usually pass without causing harm. But applying fire to a child’s feet, forcing things into their mouth, or panicking with harmful traditional remedies can turn a manageable condition into a life-threatening one.
The same goes for other practices during omugwo—like using ash or toothpaste on the umbilical cord, or the disturbing pricking of a newborn girl’s clitoris—a form of female genital mutilation—in the name of tradition. These things are dangerous. They’re not culture—they’re harmful habits that must stop.
This book was born out of passion, yes—but also purpose. I wrote it so you’ll know better and do better.
Your baby deserves knowledge-backed care. 
And as a parent, you need to act with knowledge—not panic—when your baby needs you the most.
Let’s build a generation that thrives—not just survives.
