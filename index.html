            <p>
              Dr. OVO was barely 10 years old when he watched his little sister
              die from something that should never have taken her life. Today,
              his work is preventing one maternal and child death every 30
              seconds in communities across Africa. If you have ever been
              bothered, what you need to know medically as it regards sex, who
              to marry, how to plan for pregnancy and safe delivery, raise kids
              that are always healthy, and retain your spark as a woman, or as a
              couple, this book covers it all.

                consider before accepting a man or choosing a lady, the journey
                before, in and after pregnancy, how to nurse healthy babies, and
                how to maintain your spark after each pregnancy. All common
                reasons why babies die and how to keep yours (or your future
                kids) safe, and just so much more.

        <h2>Why I wrote this book</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Victor, but many know me as Dr. OVO. I’m a husband, a dad,
          a passionate African change agent, a medical doctor, a writer, and now
          the author of this book—My Family Companion. But long before my big
          moves, preventing one maternal and child death every 30 seconds in
          communities across Africa, I was just a 10-year-old boy living in a
          quiet neighborhood with my parents and siblings. One night changed my
          life forever.
          <a href="#" id="toggle-about" class="read-toggle-inline">See More</a>
        </p>
        <div id="about-more" class="more-content hidden">
          <p>
            It was around midnight. I was fast asleep like every other child
            should be. Suddenly, I was jolted awake by screams from the sitting
            room. Something in those voices wasn’t normal— it wasn’t the usual
            noise of adults talking or scolding. This was panic. Urgency. Fear.
            I rushed out of our room, and there they were—my parents and a few
            neighbors gathered around my baby sister. She was just about 8
            months old. Her tiny body was stiff, jerking uncontrollably.
            Everyone was shouting suggestions at once.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hold her down!” “Put a spoon in her mouth before she swallows her
            tongue!” “Get onions! Squeeze it into her nose!” “Put her legs over
            the fire—she’s cold!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The noise was deafening, the chaos overwhelming. But what struck me
            most was that everyone was so sure—so convinced that those were the
            right things to do. Nobody knew what was really happening, but
            nobody wanted to be quiet either. As a child, I stood there, frozen.
            Something deep inside me—something I can’t even explain—was definite
            that everything they were doing was wrong. I didn’t have the words
            or the confidence to speak, but I knew they weren’t right. We later
            found out she had suffered a febrile convulsion—a fairly common
            condition in infants when their fever spike. In fact, if they had
            not interfered, her outcome could have been better. But what
            happened instead was a tragedy. The well-meaning interventions
            caused injuries that led to months of hospitalization, costly
            treatments, and eventually… her death. We lost her.
          </p>
          <p>
            My little sister. And I lost something too—my innocence. That night,
            I became someone else. I didn’t just watch my sister suffer—I
            watched helplessly as ignorance cost her life. I made a vow that
            night. I didn’t say it out loud, but I meant it with every fiber of
            my being: I will become a doctor. I will make sure no child ever
            dies like this again—not on my watch. That painful night planted a
            seed in me, and this book is one of the fruits. Every page, every
            chapter, every word is written with her memory in my heart and with
            the hope that one mother, one father, one family will read and make
            better choices—so their child gets to live, thrive, and grow.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, I was shocked! I got into medical school and began to see that
            my story was not unique; I witnessed many other avoidable
            tragedies—young ladies getting rhesus sensitized and never being
            able to conceive babies ever again, children dying from simply
            growing new teeth, miscarriages happening in women treating malaria,
            healthy babies sleeping and dying in their sleep, and so many very
            odd experiences. What seemed like routine cases to my colleagues and
            teachers, were to me, deep personal stories of frustration,
            confusion, and pain—mostly caused by a lack of clear, accessible
            health information. Families were losing too many women and children
            to conditions that could have been prevented if people simply had
            the right knowledge. That realization birthed the desire to write a
            compelling book that is completely relatable to a non-medical
            reader, covering all common issues from singlehood through pregnancy
            to parenting.
          </p>
          <p>
            That book is now here—My Family Companion. It is rich with real
            stories (shared by real people) of common issues that affect young
            sexually active singles, medical insights for choosing sex and
            marriage partners, tips for having safe pregnancy and deliveries,
            how and why babies get sick and die, including healthy ones who
            simple die in their sleep, and how to prevent these or what to do in
            strange scenarios, and so, so, so much more that will blow every
            readers mind.
          </p>

          <p>
            My very senior colleague, who has done extensive health work across
            the world, read the book, and this was his review:
          </p>
          <p>“As a doctor</p>
          <p>As a writer</p>
          <p>And just as a person</p>
          <p>
            My Family Companion is simply the best, most relatable, ‘medically
            non-medical’books I’ve ever read.
